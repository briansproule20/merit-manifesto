# Merit Systems

> **The coordination company for the information economy**

Merit Systems is building the infrastructure for a new commons where builders truly own what they build, attribution flows naturally, and human ingenuity is properly aligned and incentivized toward humanity's biggest challenges.

**Publisher's Retrospective**
The Merit Systems Manifesto was year's long proof of concept: it wasn't just describing better coordination systems; it was the output of better coordination systems. Four people with different expertise had collaborated fluidly, contributed according to their strengths, and shipped something none of them could have built alone. Physical manifestos that prove their own pointâ€”when you give talented people the right coordination tools and incentives, they build things that matter. Sam handled the strategic vision, Ryan brought the technical framework and Emily solved the design problems.
