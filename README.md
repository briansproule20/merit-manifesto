# Merit Systems

> **The coordination company for the information economy**

Merit Systems is building the infrastructure for a new commons where builders truly own what they build, attribution flows naturally, and human ingenuity is properly aligned and incentivized toward humanity's biggest challenges.

Publisher's Retrospective
The Merit Systems Manifesto became a year-long proof of concept. It wasn't just describing better coordination systemsâ€”it was the output of better coordination systems. Four people with different expertise collaborated fluidly, contributed according to their strengths, and shipped something none of them could have built alone.
Sam handled the strategic vision, Ryan brought the technical framework, Emily solved the design problems, and the publishing pipeline transformed it all into physical reality. The final manifestos prove their own point: when you give talented people the right coordination tools and incentives, they build things that matter.
