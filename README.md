# Merit Systems

> **The coordination company for the information economy**

Merit Systems is building the infrastructure for a new commons where builders truly own what they build, attribution flows naturally, and human ingenuity is properly aligned and incentivized toward humanity's biggest challenges.

## üéØ Mission

We invent, architect, and deploy systems that enable developers to collaborate and share in the upside of their creations. We facilitate a free economy that connects the best minds with the best ideas, creating an engine that focuses humanity's largest lever toward shared prosperity.

## üöÄ Vision: A New Commons

We envision a future where:
- **Market forces, not subsidies, guide innovation**
- **Builders capture sustainable value through direct monetization**
- **Ideas and expertise flow freely across organizational boundaries**
- **Long-term work captures its future value**

## üîß The Problem We're Solving

### Open Source Funding Crisis
Although open source software underpins 95% of commercial software, funding its development remains a perennial challenge. Current models fall short:

- **Venture Capital**: Demands exponential returns that don't match the linear growth of critical infrastructure
- **Big Tech Subsidies**: Creates profit deserts and distorts market signals through strategic "free" software
- **Result**: Developers face a stark choice between burnout and finding a benefactor

### Coordination at Scale
Modern innovation requires coordinating thousands of brilliant minds, yet our tools for organizing human potential remain primitive:
- Market signals are broken
- Creators starve for resources  
- Innovation engines strain against outdated architectures
- Traditional management structures constrain the dynamic nature of open source networks

## üí° Our Approach

### Core Values
- **Build for Humankind**: Create tools that increase abundance for humanity
- **Merit over Credentials**: Recognize value and performance, not resum√© credentials
- **Climbing the Tallest Mountain**: Pursue the most difficult paths and challenges relentlessly
- **Fundamental Transformation**: Change the world, not just incremental improvements

### Open Source Philosophy
We believe in:
- **Attribution by default**: Every contributor rewarded in proportion to their merit
- **Fluid collaboration**: Contributors flowing freely between projects with diverse motivations
- **Edge innovation**: Supporting the long tail where breakthrough ideas emerge
- **Collective intelligence**: Robust systems evolving naturally through shared expertise

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Merit Systems designs coordination mechanisms for:
- **Fluid teams** working across project boundaries
- **Partial attention** models that respect diverse contributor motivations  
- **Edge-to-center contribution flows** from independent minds globally
- **Scalable attribution** that preserves individual agency
- **Sustainable value capture** for long-term infrastructure development

## üåü Join the Revolution

The future of innovation is:
- Distributed collaboration at global scale
- Portable expertise across organizational boundaries
- Non-linear recognition of creative contribution
- Market-driven resource allocation to critical infrastructure

**We're building the organizational tooling of a species that has ascended to the stars.**
