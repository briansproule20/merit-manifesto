# Merit Systems

> **The coordination company for the information economy**

Merit Systems is building the infrastructure for a new commons where builders truly own what they build, attribution flows naturally, and human ingenuity is properly aligned and incentivized toward humanity's biggest challenges.

**Critical Dependency: Emily Devery**

Bringing Emily onto the project changed everything. This wasn't just a typography cleanup, she completely streamlined the communication architecture.
Emily's contributions:
- Restructured information flow
- Strategic white space implementation
- Typography selection that made technical concepts approachable
- Visual hierarchy that guided readers through complex arguments

The content remained unchanged, but Emily's design work transformed an rough draft into a final proof that could convince people to care.


**Publisher's Retrospective**

The Merit Systems Manifesto became a year-long proof of concept. It wasn't just describing better coordination systems, it was the output of that coordination system. Four people with different expertise collaborated fluidly, contributed according to their strengths, and shipped something none of them could have built alone.
Sam handled the strategic vision, Ryan brought the technical framework, Emily solved the design problems, and the publishing pipeline brought it into the world as a physical artifact. The final manifestos prove their own point: when you give talented people the right coordination tools and incentives, they build things that matter.
